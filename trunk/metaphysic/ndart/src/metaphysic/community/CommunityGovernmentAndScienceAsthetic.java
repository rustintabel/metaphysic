     * The community organism sets up its infrastructure as we fill our cupboards from the store.

     * asthetics (creativity with limitations) and minimize aseticism (suffering for gain).
     * 
     * This is more like the printmaking asthetic as we plant feilds and build aquaducts
     * as one organism leaving footprints.
