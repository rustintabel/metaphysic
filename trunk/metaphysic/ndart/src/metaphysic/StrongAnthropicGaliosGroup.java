 * A layer of complexity is distinguished between two occurances of
 * a brain body world cell like reflective symetry.
 * abstractly these cells are then composed of cells in a simple way 
 * which can be expressed as a galios group 
 * roughly speaking a number of cells of the same type are each capeable of 
 * a sort of bag of tricks or combinaations of actions of their organs
 * a modual of these is likely to do any combination of actions
 * and the combinations of these can be capabble of very consistantly 
 * providing in some way for a modual of these moduals or organ if provided intelligence
 * from a brain which is reflecting combinations of the cells environment.
 * This symetry is repeated any number of times up or down as a fractle.
 * 
 * At each layer of complexity from atoms to communities the moduals of the same 
 * can be simply represented as the combinations of the capabilities of any cell averaged over all the
 * cells of the tissue catylized by information controling the flow of actions of the cells
 * 
 * information requires a sort of clock cycle and brain body and world(the kind of space a cell
 * can live in) surprisingly
 * i have found are each a significantly differant kind of information cycle
 * from three basic types(recombination,copying,print making) or (miosis,mitosis,and sight) and 
 * any organ which serves that roll at any level is 
 * predominantly exibiting that behaviour in its cells. and so a group theoretical
 * mathematical symetry is manifest each cycle is an automorphism and their composition is 
 * a feild and the two are isomorphic and together form a galios group.
