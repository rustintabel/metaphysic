To explain real quick if you look at the painting at the end of this page 

https://sites.google.com/site/moralitytechnology/Disclaimer

 you will see hearts hands and feet.

 one circle inside the other means the outside one is made out of
 millions of the inside one.

 heart means recombination like sex
 hand means copying like mitosis
 foot means printmaking like a sense

 going from one circle to the other i noticed that there is a simple formula
 flip two then shift them all back one.

 this is an information field composed of millions of the four
 information vectors (quadrants)

 it is mathematically a galios group the inside circle an automorphism
 and the outside one a feild which reflects it.

 this particular painting is at the level of organisms specifically
 humans and the outside circle is a comunity.

 and the thing which flows here is asthetic content through the flip shift.

 the flip is just the asthetic structure of the same modual being used
 differantly in vs. out.

 and the shift if caused by aquiring the asthetic of whom you are
 talking to(language).

 cool eh?
