To explain real quick if you look at the painting at the end of this page

and here is a poster I am selling which explains the metaphysics very intuitively.

> The base field a reflectively symmetric (with respect to the outside edge) automorphism with respect to the composition of two of the three fundamental aesthetics into vectors in and out of the brain.  distributive over the first automorphism is a second which is the same and physically around the first.

If L is an extension of F which is in turn an extension of K, then F is said to be an intermediate field (or intermediate extension or sub extension) of the field extension L /K.

Over three layers of complexity the cyclic permutation repeats and so the three fundamental aesthetics and the vectors between them represents and reacts in its environment with small fast parts. Six reflective symmetries with respect to 6 surfaces exist in the fractle dimensions of the field extension. The surface of the brain is a mirror reflecting compositions of the organs of the body and brain into vectors in vs. out. Distributive over this at each layer of bodies is the mirror of the outside edge of the body reflecting compositions of the organs of the senses and the organs of the body into vector organs in vs. out. The second of three rows always doubly reflects first through these two reflective auto morphisms and then through the mirror of self similarity of the fractle dimensions resulting in the composition of brain body and body sense vectors bearing the reflective symmetry with respect to a plane through the body around the nucleus in vs. out. As well as a two way mirror symmetry dividing the controller in half. And finally the third field extension of the cyclic permutation bears a mirror symmetry though the body between the outside edge of the brain and body. And another in vs. out.

Each layer of complexity is paired with the one above it through its self similarity cyclic permutation group [3,4,1,2][2,3,1,4] of its four fractle vectors. Each cycle of four fractle vector quadrants orbits the hand homunculus because this one dimensional circle goes through the three fractle aesthetics in and out of the brain and body just off center.

Each Fractle aesthetics is contained in a field above and have another embedded in it(which is self similar by fractle geometry).
> If S consists of only one element s, K(s) is a shorthand for K({s}). A field extension of the form L = K(s) is called a simple extension and s is called a primitive element of the extension.

An algebraic extension L/K is called normal if every irreducible polynomial in K[X](X.md) that has a root in L completely factors into linear factors over L. Every algebraic extension F/K admits a normal closure L, which is an extension field of F such that L/K is normal and which is minimal with this property.

An algebraic extension L/K is called separable if the minimal polynomial of every element of L over K is separable, i.e., has no repeated roots in an algebraic closure over K. A Galois extension is a field extension that is both normal and separable.

This field is separable as the outside edge of the cell (eyes,hands) are embedded in each  of the outside edges of the body and brain (thus creating two fractle mirrors). these organs are then divided in two with respect to out versus in and up vs down through layers of complexity.
