 //and arbitrary files list xml file for print making files
 //this asthetic is a physical system in general as a computer the result of iterative
 //physical interaction resulting in an imprint which can be maped to an image file.
 //the brain here is the physical imprint, the body is the physcial structure
 //of the matter it is composed of. Treated as an entity like the cell its self
 //this asthetic outputs from its brain to the eye of the organ layer of complexity.
    //its hand is the way it reacts to interaction its eye is action upon it
    //(both represented by the part of the image which is not the imprint).
    //the brain is simply entropy in time and the organs are complexity (the oposit of entropy)
    //the hand and eye humunculous is abstractly the brain to body action of some other cell
    //the organs fight this entropy with a combinatoric contruction of cells 
    //mirroing a probabiliity distribution of electrons right through to the atomic level.
    //the key here being that stuff made by cells reflect combinations of the actions of thheir organs.
    //organs are as to cells and bodies as this level is to the level below 
    //a recipe is thhe most intuitive example of thhis.
