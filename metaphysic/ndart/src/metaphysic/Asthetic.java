 * two trees intersected in a yellow wood. 
 * one representation for many examples as moduls of the brain to the organs of the body.
 * many examples together working as an organ as organs are composed into a body.
 * + Means composition with respect to the three fundamental asthetics brain,body,nich.
 * as one is inside the next this is noncommutative. 
 * The third asthetic or nich is the connections of this cell to others
 * or thoes cells that this cell interacts with most. your nich accumulates entropy in
 * its physical material over time this is the brain of the third asthetic.
 * Your nich iterates as some of your peers act and react succesivly.
 * And your nich is closed with respect to combinations of what your organs can do and matter 
 * for you to survive. and reusable action and reaction are abstractly hand and eye. 
 * * Means composition with respect to two symetry shells and the layer of complexity between them.
 * since one layer is composed of the other and the moduals of the organs between them this like
 * addition is non commutative.
 * Asthetics composed in this way create an information and entropy feild.
 * A galios group exists in this field with the automorphism which is the 
 * symetric transformations of each quadrant of the abstract circle from hand to eye.
 * A backbone of recombination supports this life force 
 * and so it is most reasonable to add a reference to the body moduals to
 * the corresponding brain modual and you get a hand and eye hummunculous as a consequence.
